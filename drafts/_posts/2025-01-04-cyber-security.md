In an increasingly interconnected and digital world, our data (be it business or personal) has become a valuable commodity. Unfortunately this makes it a target for crime, and so ensuring you are giving regular consideration to how you secure your network and systems is of vital importance.

The [UK 2024 cyber security breaches survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024) determined that half of business and around a third of charities reported having experienced some form of cyber security breach or attack in the 12 months prior to April 2024. So it is less a question of if you will be attacked, but when. There's never been a better time to consider cyber security, which needs to include educating and preparing staff as well as securing systems.

# Types of attack

There are many different kinds of cyber attack, which can target both human beings and computer systems. Some of the methods used by attackers include:

## Phishing

Phishing attacks trick individuals into revealing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, credit card details) by impersonating legitimate entities through emails, texts, or fake websites. Spear phishing is a highly targeted phishing attack where attackers tailor their fraudulent messages to a specific individual, organization, or group. Unlike generic phishing, spear phishing emails or messages often appear more credible because they use personalised information, such as the target’s name, job role, or recent activities, to build trust and trick the recipient into taking harmful actions.

## Spoofing

Spoofing is a type of cyberattack where an attacker impersonates a trusted entity to deceive a target, often to gain unauthorized access to systems, steal sensitive information, or carry out other malicious activities. The goal is to make the interaction appear legitimate so that the victim takes a desired action, such as clicking a link, sharing credentials, or executing unauthorized transactions. Spyware runs silently on the system to secretly monitor a users activities and key strokes, to collect data and passwords.

## Credential stuffing

Credential stuffing is a type of cyberattack where attackers use stolen username-password combinations, often obtained from data breaches, to attempt unauthorized access to multiple accounts. The attack exploits the common practice of password reuse across different platforms. If a platform that you've previously used suffered a data breach (in which usernames and passwords were stolen) then your credentials may have been exposed, and an attacker can attempt to use it to access other systems where you may have used the same password.

## Malware

Malware is malicious software, including viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware, designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to systems. Often disguised as a legitimate program, once executed malicious code can cause damage and spread to other systems on the network. Ransomware will lock users our of their system or files until a ransom has been paid (usually demanded by the attacker via a cryptocurrency for anonymity).

## System Vulnerabilities

System vulnerabilities are weaknesses or flaws in software, hardware, or configurations that attackers can exploit to compromise security. These vulnerabilities can result from coding errors, design oversights, improper configurations, or outdated systems. Unpatched systems or older operating systems/software that no longer receive security updates from their vendor can be particularly vulnerable.

## Denial of service

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a cyberattack aimed at making a system, server, or network unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming it with excessive traffic or resource demands. Attackers may have access to a large number of bots, potentially running on other breached systems without those users knowledge. They can then use these bots to direct legitimate seeming traffic to a one particular website or endpoint, blocking legitimate connections from being able to connect.
