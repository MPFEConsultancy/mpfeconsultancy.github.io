In an increasingly interconnected and digital world, our data (be it business or personal) has become a valuable commodity. Unfortunately this makes it a target for crime, and so ensuring you are giving regular consideration to how you secure your network and systems is of vital importance.

The [UK 2024 cyber security breaches survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024) determined that half of business and around a third of charities reported having experienced some form of cyber security breach or attack in the 12 months prior to April 2024. So it is less a question of if you will be attacked, but when. There's never been a better time to consider cyber security, which needs to include educating and preparing staff as well as securing systems.

# Types of attack

There are many different kinds of cyber attack, which can target both human beings and computer systems. Some of the methods used by attackers include:

## Phishing

Phishing attacks trick individuals into revealing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, credit card details) by impersonating legitimate entities through emails, texts, or fake websites.

**Target:** Human error and trust.

## Malware

Malware is malicious software, including viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware, designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to systems. Often disguised as a legitimate program, once executed malicious code can cause damage and spread to other systems on the network. Ransomware will lock users our of their system or files until a ransom has been paid (usually demanded by the attacker via a cryptocurrency for anonymity).

**Target:** Computers, networks, or devices.

## Spoofing

Spoofing is a type of cyberattack where an attacker impersonates a trusted entity to deceive a target, often to gain unauthorized access to systems, steal sensitive information, or carry out other malicious activities. The goal is to make the interaction appear legitimate so that the victim takes a desired action, such as clicking a link, sharing credentials, or executing unauthorized transactions. Spyware runs silently on the system to secretly monitor a users activities and key strokes, to collect data and passwords.

## Ransomware

A type of malware that locks users out of their systems or encrypts their files until a ransom is paid.

Target: Critical data and operations.


## Credential Stuffing

Using stolen credentials from one breach to access other accounts, leveraging users' habit of reusing passwords.

Target: User accounts.

## Denial of service

Overloading a system, server, or network with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

Target: Online services or networks.
