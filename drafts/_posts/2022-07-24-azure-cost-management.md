# Use the Cost Management dashboard to understand your costs

- Look across different time periods to understand your trends / cost patterns. Costs are unlikely to be static.

# Ensure ownership and perform regular reviews

- Cost Advisor
- Automate: Use of PowerShell to total up costs for specific periods / perform comparisons

# Configure budgets and billing alerts

# Use multiple subscriptions as a way to organise and control costs

# Fully automate the creation and destruction of environments (and get good at it)

# Control waste


# Purchase Reservations


# Combine resources

By having a single implementation of Log Analytics, you may reach ingestion levels that then enable the purchase of capacity reservations.
