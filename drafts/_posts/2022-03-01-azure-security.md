It is important to consider security throughout the lifecycle of your cloud resources. The Microsoft Azure platform provides tools and capabilities that can be leveraged to create secure solutions, but these must be carefully considered and deliberately implemented. Azure also provides services that can be leveraged for additional cost to monitor and manage threats and vulnerabilities. New attack vectors are discovered every day and its not unusual for hackers to breach systems weeks or months before they leverage the illegal access for malicious means. Maintaining your security in the cloud needs to be an ongoing and equally evolving process.
