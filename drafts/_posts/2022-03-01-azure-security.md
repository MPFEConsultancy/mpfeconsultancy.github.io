  Cloud security is a shared responsibility between the cloud provider and you: the customer. It is important to consider security throughout the lifecycle of your cloud deployments. This article explores some of the security tools and capabilities that are available within the Microsoft Azure platform.

It is important to consider security throughout the lifecycle of your cloud deployments. The Microsoft Azure platform provides tools and capabilities that can be leveraged to create secure solutions, but these must be carefully considered and deliberately implemented. Azure also provides a number of security services and plans that can be leveraged for additional cost to monitor and manage threats and vulnerabilities. New attack vectors are discovered every day and it is not unusual for hackers to breach systems weeks or months before they leverage their unauthorised access for malicious means. Maintaining your security in the cloud needs to be an ongoing and equally evolving process.

# Getting started

A good starting point when considering security in Azure is to review the [Introduction to Azure security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/overview) Microsoft documentation page.

At a high level, this encourages you to consider:

- What operating systems, programming languages, frameworks, tools, database technologies and devices are leveraging (or planning to leverage) on Azure?
- How will you monitor, detect and respond to threats within your cloud resources?
- How will you manage the deployment of resources and control, manage and monitor changes to your cloud infrastructure and applications?
- How will you detect vulnerabilities in your cloud applications?
- How will you control access to your cloud storage?
- How will you limit access between specific devices and subnets and ensure that the minimum required access is enabled?
- How will you detect and block malicious software on your Virtual Machines or other compute services?
- How will you recover your service should malicious activity or disruption occur?
- How will you limit, monitor and control access to your Azure resources and manage access to your applications?
