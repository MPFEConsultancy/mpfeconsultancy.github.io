First published in 2012, Amazon Web Services (AWS) the Well-Architected Framework is a collection of best practice guidelines to help customers to implement high quality solutions and infrastructure in the AWS cloud. The framework currently features six pillars:

- Operational Excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance Efficiency
- Cost Optimization
- Sustainability

Other cloud providers have similar frameworks, and we've blogged about the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://mpfe.uk/blog/2021-04-01-azure-well-architected-framework/) previously.

> The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand trade-offs for decisions you make while building workloads on AWS.

## Operational Excellence

Operational Excellence is less about what you build in AWS and more about how you organise your teams or business to achieve business outcomes. It is about evaluating the needs of your internal and external customers, any governance or compliance requirements and potential threats. From this you can determine an appropriate operating model to meet the needs of your business or a mix of models to meet the needs of different teams. You should establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and leverage telemetry to ensure you can make informed decisions. Safely automate where possible, such as ensuring your application, infrastructure, configuration and procedures are defined and maintained as code. Keep changes frequent but small, so they can be easily reversed. Perform regular reviews of your operational procedures so they can be continuously improved. Expect failures to occur, and plan for them by identifying the risks and rehearsing your responses to outages.
