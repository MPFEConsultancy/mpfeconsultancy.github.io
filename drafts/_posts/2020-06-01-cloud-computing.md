Cloud Computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers (or services), either via the internet or private WAN connection in order to satisfy a computing need. Cloud providers offer a large (and ever growing) array of services to meet a variety of generalist and specialist needs, such as compute, network and storage through to artifical intelligence, big data, analytics and more. Cloud providers give a perception of "infinite scale", by constantly adding capacity to meet demand. They remove the need to concern yourself with the maintenance or purchase of the hardware or platform as well as the physical security of the services you leverage.

The three major cloud computing providers are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
