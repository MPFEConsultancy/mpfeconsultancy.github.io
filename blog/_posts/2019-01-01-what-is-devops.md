DevOps is a way of working that brings the functions of Software Development and Operations closer together in order to improve the speed and safety of Software Delivery. DevOps is about breaking the "silos" of traditional IT teams, allowing for a collaborative and automated approach in order to deploy software changes more frequently and with more stability.

There are many advantages to delivering software more quickly:

- Faster delivery of features
- Faster resolution of issues/bugs
- More stable environments
- Improved innovation/experimentation
- Less time spent planning/preparing for changes

By delivering features more quickly customer needs are met in less time, saving development costs and improving customer satisfaction. Fixes can also be delivered in less time, resulting in greater stability/uptime and less time wasted applying workarounds.
